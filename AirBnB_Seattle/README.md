## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using publicly accessible AirBnB data, available on Inside AirBnB:

1. Where prices are usually higher?
2. How the price behaves during the year?
3. Machine Learning(Feature importances) XGBoost


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBnB for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the link available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
